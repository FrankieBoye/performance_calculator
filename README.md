## Introduction

'Performance Calculator' is a web app designed to compute the following car performance statistics:
bhp per tonne, 0-60, 0-100 and the Quarter Mile time to the nearest second.

## Getting Started

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:FrankieBoye/performance_calculator.git
> cd performance_calculator
> npm install
> npm start
```
Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) on your web browser.

## Usage
When the app is completed, you will be able to select the driven wheels for your car, enter the flywheel horsepower (BHP) and the kerb weight in KG. The calculator will then compute the figures.

Work in progress!

#### Update

I have met my MVP and can calculate the required figures.

There is still plenty of work to do.<br>

1. User stories are still to be written to explain the reason for the application.

2. Tests have to be written for the code.

3. I need to clarify the meanings of 'RWD' (rear wheel drive), 'FWD' (front wheel drive) and 'AWD' (all wheel drive) on the app. I may break that down further still as there is RR (rear engine rear wheel drive) and FR (front engine rear wheel drive) for example which will have a bearing on the performance times.

4. Formatting, fonts and general styling need refinement.

## Deployment

The application will be deployed on Heroku.
