## Introduction

'Performance Calculator' is a web app designed to compute the following car performance statistic times:
0-60, 0-100, 60-100 and Quarter Mile.

## Getting Started

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:FrankieBoye/performance_calculator.git
> cd performance_calculator
> npm install
> npm start
```
Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) on your web browser.

## Usage
When the app is completed, you will be able to select the driven wheels for your car, enter the flywheel horsepower(BHP) and the kerb weight in KG. The calculator will then compute the performance times.

Work in progress!
